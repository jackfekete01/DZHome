# DZHome

DZHome is a Python GUI script that allows users to interact with detrital zircon U-Pb data sets by plotting data, creating maximum depositional age (MDA) approximations, comparing similarity/ dissimilarity metrics, and exploring the effects of hydrodynamic fractionation on DZ age populations. DZHome allows users to harness the analytical power of Python through an easy-to-use GUI. DZHome can be implemented via a Jupyter Notebook or Py file.
